# CS 559 Project 2 Notes #

## Shapes to model ##
- Cylinder
- Skewed disk
  - Can make a regular disk by using a skewed disk with height 0
- Cube
- Torus

## Mesh ##
- Professor said to possibly use a mesh class hold the vertices
  - That way I can define a way to draw the vertices once and then just reuse it as I need to
- Maybe have a surface, stored by increasing y-coordinate

## three.js stuff ##
- Rotations are in RADIANS
